My children love to run around the house with their daddy.  I love it just as much as they do :-) We wrestle and play on the floor, and we also play chase! The kids run and run, trying to catch me. I use my size, quickness and intelligence to allude them. But eventually I'll be sure that they catch me, and we all enjoy the embrace after the chase.

Sometimes I envision God in this manner. No, I'm not making a theological case or anything... But one thing I do know... He wants to be pursued! Matthew 7:7 tells us to ask (& keep on asking), to seek (& keep on seeking), & to knock (and keep on knocking)! Jeremiah & Deuteronomy both say we'll find Him if we seek Him with all of our hearts! He wants us to pursue Him!

I'm not totally sure why God wants us to pursue Him... Maybe it's like me having fun with my children (probably not) .... Maybe It's because He knows when we focus on Him, and not ourselves, we will have peace & be peacemakers (Isaiah 26:3).... Maybe it's because He knows that in His Presence we'll find all that we need.... I'm know there are a lot of benefits in engaging in the pursuit!

Here's an additional thought... A lot of times we can't find answers to questions... Don't know how to solve problems... & it feels like God is hiding it from us. That is FAR from the case! He's not hiding things from us, but FOR US! He's got all we need hidden away for us! We know how to find it.... By seeking Him with our WHOLE HEART!

Let us stop walking in self deception and pursue a passionate relationship with our Heavenly Father who longs to be with us! Let us find all we need as we run after His Heart! Let us take time... No, MAKE TIME... For Him DAILY! And MAKE HIM the center of EVERYTHING we do and everything we are! 

"Be doers of the Word & not hearers only, deceiving OURSELVES!"

Be a Blessing
